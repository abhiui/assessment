### Asssumptions;

I am getting CORS issue when I try to use the API with authorization header. Because of it I could not consume the API. But I have written the service such that code is in place and ready to consume.

I have used API response from the POST man to show on the UI. Please see the below components.

`RestaurantsContainer.js` 

In the above file, please take a look at componentDidMount method.
